EDACC API
=========

Experiment Design and Administration for Computer Clusters for SAT Solvers.
See http://sourceforge.net/projects/edacc/ for the EDACC project.

This API provides an interface to EDACC databases to submit jobs, query their results etc.
Its primary use is for algorithm tuners, so-called configurators, that want to make use of
EDACC's job processing backend.

It also implements parameter space functionality that helps configurators to navigate through
the parameter space of a solver.
